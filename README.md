# Financial-Q-A-System
Interactive Python system to query financial data from a dataset. 

This project is an interactive system that allows users to query financial data using **natural language**. It was built as an assignment to demonstrate how raw financial data can be transformed into meaningful insights through Python and NLP.

## Features
- Users can ask questions in plain English.
- System answers questions directly from a pre-loaded financial dataset.
- Key metrics include **Revenue**, **Profit**, and **Expenses**.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface for demonstration purposes.

## Example Questions
The system can answer questions like:
- "What’s the total revenue?"
- "What’s the total profit?"
- "How much were the total expenses?"

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and logic implementation.
- **Pandas**: For dataset manipulation and analysis.
- **NLP techniques**: To interpret and understand natural language queries.

## How to Run
Navigate to the project folder:

cd financial-qa-system


Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the main Python script:

python main.py


Type your financial questions in plain English and get answers from the dataset.

Notes

Currently, the system works on a pre-loaded dataset.

NLP is used to interpret questions and fetch the relevant information.

Future improvements could include dynamic uploads of financial documents.
